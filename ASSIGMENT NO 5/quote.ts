let famous_person = "JOHNNY DEPP,"
let message = ("If there’s any message to my work, it is ultimately that it’s OK to be different, that it’s good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color.");
console.log(famous_person,message);
